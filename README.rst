PySIMD
======

``simd`` is the python module for SIMD computing and programming. It
prodives an extensive interface to SIMD instruction sets on several different 
architectures, and fallback scalar implementations when no SIMD instructions 
are available for a particular operation. ``simd`` provides vector objects, 
which are collections of bytes aligned on a minimum boundary. The main advantage
of using SIMD instructions is the potentially masive performance
improvements over regular, scalar instructions.

``simd`` is a C extension, that is only compatible with Python 3. When
built, it will do compile time checks to see what SIMD instructions are
available on the current CPU. The advantage of using ``simd`` over other
libraries or implementations is this module auto-detects the best
instructions available for specific operations at install time and uses
them anytime the module is imported into a Python program.

Installation
------------

To install ``simd``, run the following ``pip`` command

::

    $ pip install simd

Usage
-----

The ``simd`` module can be used primarily through vector objects. Vector
objects are special C objects that contain a portion of bytes aligned on
at least a 16 byte boundary. This alignment allows SIMD operations to be
performed at a higher scale, without needing to worry about the leftover
bytes at the end of a data segment.

Creation
~~~~~~~~

You can make an empty vector with a size

.. code:: py

    >>> import simd
    >>> a = simd.Vec(size=32)
    >>> a
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Or make a vector from a repeated value

.. code:: py

    >>> a = simd.Vec(size=32, repeat_value=64, repeat_size=2)
    >>> a
    [40,0,40,0,40,0,40,0,40,0,40,0,40,0,40,0,40,0,40,0,40,0,40,0,40,0,40,0,40,0,40,0]

Note: the ``__repr__`` method of ``Vec`` , implemented in C, displays a
hexadecimal byte representation of the vector.

However, if a size used cannot be aligned by 16 bytes, an error is
thrown

.. code:: py

    >>> a = simd.Vec(size=31, repeat_value=64, repeat_size=2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    simd.SimdError: The size '31' cannot be aligned by at least 16 bytes

Operations
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``simd`` module supports a wide variety of operations, such as plain
addition:

.. code:: py

    >>> a = simd.Vec(size=32, repeat_value=1, repeat_size=1)
    >>> b = simd.Vec(size=32, repeat_value=1, repeat_size=1)
    >>> a
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
    >>> b
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
    >>> a.add(b, width=1)
    >>> a
    [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]

There are also operations to retrieve the data in the vector back as
python types, such as with ``as_bytes()``

.. code:: py

    >>> a = simd.Vec(size=16, repeat_value=4, repeat_size=2)
    >>> a
    [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0]
    >>> a.as_bytes(start = 3)
    b'\x00\x04\x00\x04\x00\x04\x00\x04\x00\x04\x00\x04\x00'
    >>> a.as_bytes()
    b'\x04\x00\x04\x00\x04\x00\x04\x00\x04\x00\x04\x00\x04\x00\x04\x00'
    >>> a.as_bytes(start=40)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    simd.SimdError: start: '40', is out of bounds for vector of size 16
